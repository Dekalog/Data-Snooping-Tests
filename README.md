# Data-Snooping-Tests
Code for various data snooping tests on financial time series.

The data snooping tests are

a) WhiteRealityCheck.m

b) PolitisRomanoBootstrap.m

c) mc_boot_single.m

d) position_vector_permutation_test.cc

e) opt_block_length_REV_dec07.m

and two statistical tests

f) fdr_bh.m

g) granger_cause.m

a, b, e ,f and g above were downloaded by me sometime over the last few years,
and at the time of download they were freely available with no restrictions.

c and d were written by me.
c is a very simple implementation of White's Reality check for a single test.
d is an Octave .Oct implementation of the permutation test as detailed in
